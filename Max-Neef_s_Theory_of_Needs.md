Beyond Basic Needs and Maslow’s Hierarchy, Max-Neef’s Theory of Needs provides a different value theory with which to conceptualize meeting needs, wants, and desires. In Max-Neef’s characterization, what is considered basic needs arise from a conception based on human bio-psycho-social needs.

Max-Neef classifies the fundamental human needs as: subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, recreation(in the sense of leisure, time to reflect, or idleness), creation, identity and freedom. Needs are also defined according to the existential categories of being, having, doing and interacting, and from these dimensions, a 36 cell matrix is developed which can be filled with examples of satisfiers for those needs.

Travailler avec les énergies existante dans le système et les débloquer/libérer.


There is life energy in any situation or system. Someimes these energies are suppressed, unrealized, frozen, or opposed to each other. A transformational agent recognizes them as resources, regardless.

A major aspect of such life energy  is its motivating power: bottom up participatory activities arise from - and are sustained by - the interests, needs, passions, and responsability of those involved.

Parts of transformational leadership and artistry is clarifying and calling forth these motivating energies to engage creatively with the challenges at hand.

The transformational approach involves working with already existing energies and situations, guided by questions like these:

- Where can suppressed passions be prioductivelly empowered ?
- Where are key players embattled, overwhelmed, or uncoordinated, mired in situations which, if addressed well, would free up their life energy to make vital contributions ?
- what systemic issues are hot in the public mind, where attention could be shifted from complaining to systemic insight and transformation ?
- where is an issue or system reaching a crisis point or generating one or more trigger events such that the right questions and conversations could unleash a storm of high energy creative thinking and action ?
- what social systems - like political, economic, educationnal and philantropic systems - and system dynamics - likepurposes, incentives and feedbacks - if successfully shifted - could impact how the whole society behaved ?

Mathew Lynch - sustainable business building

1. Invest in regenerative assets: in case of crisis, is the asset feeding or eating business ?
2. Contributes to communities
3. Collaborates before it competes
4. Competes constructively: destructive (sabotage, monopoly), constructive (make a better product)
5. Crafts lasting products, deliver remarkable services
6. Looks after people, planet, profit. in that order

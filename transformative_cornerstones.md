## Cornerstone 1: Historical and contextual complexities

**The  first  transformative  cornerstone  of  social  science  research sets out to elucidate the full complexity of global change  processes  in  modern  societies.**

Here  the  work  for  social  science  is  to  understand  the  political  econ-omy  of  climate  and  other  processes  of  environmental  change,  and  to  understand  how  these  processes  relate  to  a  multitude  of  other  social  crises.  it  is  to  distinguish  between different yet interconnected stressors and driv-ers  of  global  change,  and  to  clarify  the  interdependen-cies  of  peoples’  vulnerabilities  to  these  and  a  range  of  other  social  processes,  such  as  migration  or  conflict.  Situating  global  change  processes  in  this  way  also  calls  for  in-depth  historical  analyses.  Here  the  purpose  is  to  explain the complex trajectories and processes that have led  to  today’s  unsustainable  lifestyles  and  models  of  progress, and to draw lessons from earlier processes of transformative change. understanding the complexity of global  change  processes  also  entails  understanding  the  influence of context, and addressing how global change risks,  impacts,  perceptions,  experiences  and  responses  differ  across  different  regions  and  cultures  of  the  world,  across  social  classes,  gender,  race  or  faith  groupings,  and across a range of personal or professional identities.

### Historical and contextual complexities - Illustrative questions

*Distinguishing multiple stressors, drivers and interdependencies*
-   What are the multiple stressors and drivers of climate and broader processes of global change and how are these interconnected?
-   How do we -  or should we -  situate climate change in the so-called confluence of crises characterizing current global realities?
-   How does the climate crisis relate to other actual or approaching social crises, including those of unsustain-able development, finance, economic injustice, food, health, migration, poverty and security?
-   What are the causal mechanisms that connect vulnerability to global change with vulnerability to other social processes such as population displacement and migration, power inequalities and conflict?

*Learning from history*
-   What are the historical drivers that have led to high car-bon systems, lifestyles and current models of progress? How do we account for and track the influence on global change processes of dominant neoliberal think-ing and the marketization of all social life?
-   What histories -  of behaviours, institutions and systems -  have generated a world living beyond its natural limits? What predictors can we identify on the basis of such histories?
-   What lessons can we learn from environmental history case studies and how can these be replicated today?


*Dealing with differences across  geographical, cultural, personal,  professional contexts and identities*
-   What are the contextual drivers of behaviours that con-tribute to global change?
-   How are climate and related global change risks, events, actions and reactions perceived and experienced in different geographical, cultural, personal and professional contexts?
-   How are such experiences mediated by gender, race, ethnic and class identities?
-   What role do social and cultural identities play in peoples’ ability to cope with and recover from the impacts of global change?

## Cornerstone 2: Consequences - Illustrative questions

**Identifying and mapping the full range of actual and unfolding  threats  and  impacts  of  global  change  processes  on  people and communities in diverse locations is the work of the second transformative cornerstone.** 

it is about expos-ing  the  diverse  realities  of  living  with  global  change,  and  it calls for a special focus on poor and vulnerable sectors of different societies. understanding the consequences of global  change  brings  to  light  the  lives  of  climate  change  victims  and  their  coping  mechanisms,  responses,  inno-vations  and  limitations.  it  also  raises  important  questions  about social boundaries and tipping points related to envi-ronmental pressures and disasters on existing human sys-tems and economies, on the basic social fabric of life. Work on  the  consequences  of  global  change  also  requires  a  focus on existing policy solutions, technologies, and other response  measures  in  a  range  of  sectors,  including  eco-nomic  and  education  sectors.  Here  the  task  is  to  unpack  their successes and failures in iterative processes of learn-ing  aimed  at  improving  the  outcomes  of  specific  actions  and instruments.


*Living with global change: taking stock of threats and impacts  across different groups and regions*
-  What are the real threats and actual, unfolding impacts of climate and broader global change on different groups and communities in different parts of the world?
-   What are the consequences in the most vulnerable regions, such as Africa, Latin America and South Asia? 
-   What are the consequences for marginalized people and communities in advanced economies? 
-   What are the lives of the victims of global change really like, how do they perceive threats and how do they typically react, individually and socially


*Identifying social boundaries and tipping points*
-   How do people and institutions understand and antici-pate the risks of social boundaries and social tipping points in relation to global change?
-   What are the consequences of global change for the basic social fabric of life: for institutions such as the family, welfare systems, legal rules, rights and duties, or private-public interactions?
-   do the consequences of global change lead to more or less social cohesion and solidarity; to what extent do they exacerbate crisis and conflict and drive the privatization of security and militarization of society?

*Measuring success: Improving the out-comes of specific actions and instruments*
-   What are the outcomes of specific climate change policy instruments and actions, including for example economic incentives and media strategies, for both mitigation and adaptation?
-   Are these responses working well for people and socie-ties? do they lead to transformative change or do they perpetuate existing marginalisation and inequalities? 
-   What are the unintended or unexpected consequences of measures aimed at addressing the impacts of global change; what new vulnerabilities, if any, do our policies and economic measures give rise to?
-   How can we best monitor, measure and evaluate policy actions and instruments; how do we know that we are moving towards resilience and sustainability?

## Cornerstone 3: Conditions and visions for change
 
**The third transformative cornerstone addresses the impor-tant issue of change itself. it asks how change happens, at what levels and scales, and in what directions. The purpose here is to understand what drives individual and collective processes  of  change,  as  well  as  change  in  social  practices.**

It is to identify what leadership and other capacities are  required  for  successful  change  to  occur,  whilst  being  absolutely clear about the limitations and democratic pitfalls  of  deliberate  processes  of  change.  this  cornerstone  aims  to  shed  light  on  criteria  for  successful,  transforma-tive  actions  towards  equitable  sustainability  at  the  local,  community level, and on how to speed and scale those up into processes of transformative global thinking. feasible, realistic visions for change matter, but so do the methods and  procedures  by  which  they  are  built.  this  raises  fundamental questions about the ways and consequences of reframing global change – particularly climate change – as a deep systemic problem. it raises questions about differ-ent narratives of socially desirable change, associated life-styles  and  alternative  socio-economic,  technological  and  political systems. At the same time it addresses concerns about  processes  of  social  engineering,  and  asks  about  the  feasibility  of  participatory  approaches  to  determin-ing  and  achieving  alternative  visions  of  the  future.  in  this  regard building consensus on directions and mechanisms of change in ways that include marginalized as well as non-scientific views and voices is a key challenge.

### Conditions and visions for change: illustrative questions

*understanding how we can change  behaviour and social practice*
-   What drives individual and collective behavioural change and change in social practices; what are the preconditions for and barriers to change in behaviours and practices?
-   What influence does our (evolving) knowledge of global change drivers and impacts have on the decisions and practices of individuals and communities?
-   What examples do we have of successful, local trans-formative action and how can we motivate it, what mechanisms and incentives can we use?
-   to what extent are people and groups driven by altruism rather than interest? is there a role for trust and reciprocity in processes of change? And for incentives and competition? 
-   What kind of leadership is needed for change and how is it exercised in different contexts?
-   What makes for successful change agents; how do we nurture them?

*Speeding and scaling up processes of change*
-   At what scale must change happen for it to make a positive difference? 
-   How can we speed and scale up change processes, especially successful, sustainable local or community-based transformative action?
-   What would unlock the connection between such action and wider processes of transformative global thinking?
-   How do we move from individual to institutional and eventual systemic processes of change? 
-   How can we use media and new modes of social communication to increase capacities to contest climate change, envision and build alternative socio-economic systems, development trajectories and new political realities?
-   What actions are needed in crucial economic sectors – those of energy, housing, heating, cooling, transporta-tion, and agriculture – in order to ensure a decarbonization and dematerialization of the economy?


*building consensus on the directions for change*
-   What does change mean to different people and different groups? 
-   Who decides on the direction of change required? What should the role of the state be in proactively determining priorities for change?
-   What are the risks of social engineering and how do we prevent them?
-   can change processes be deliberative and participatory; can they be representative of the majority, that is, respectful of democratic principles? How can we integrate into dominant narratives of change those visions coming from non-dominant groupings, as well as non-scientific experts? 
-   What are the inherent pitfalls and dangers of processes of change – for democracy?
-   What would realistic, feasible constructions of alternative social systems and lifestyles look like; what new leitmotifs would we need to guide change towards such systems?
-   How do we achieve success in reframing climate change as a social and deep systemic problem, rather than a technical problem to be fixed?

## Cornerstone 4 : Interpretation and subjective sense making

**The fourth transformative cornerstone – interpretation and subjective sense making – confronts the personal and collective values, beliefs, assumptions, interests, worldviews, hopes,  needs  and  desires  that  underlie  people’s  experiences  of  and  responses  –  or  lack  of  responses  –  to  processes  of  global  change.**

These  are  the  component  elements of the interpretative processes that shape personal narratives  and  social  discourses  about  the  nature  of  the  world and the environment, as well as the nature and need for transformation towards global sustainability. this fourth transformative  cornerstone  challenges  social  scientists  to  make  sense  of  the  ingrained  assumptions  and  associated  blindspots  that  underlie  choices  and  priorities,  prevent awareness of that which needs to change, and keeps systems  deadlocked  in  spirals  of  inaction.  it  raises  questions about the nature and role of transformative learning in unlocking minds and motivations, and investigates the reasons for indifference, scepticism and denialism in the face of potentially cataclysmic processes of climate change



### Interpretation and subjective sense making: illustrative questions

*understanding the nature  and role of subjectivities*
-   What sets of values, beliefs, assumptions, interests, worldviews, hopes, needs and desires underlie different responses to global change and drive different visions of the kind of societies we should be striving to build?
-   What discourses and narratives of global change – those expressed in different ways of communication and forms of expression – drive our sense making, life priorities, and social agendas; and what shared social meanings do they embrace?

*exposing blindspots*
-   How can processes of transformative learning expose and alter ingrained assumptions and beliefs, opening peoples’ minds to new and multiple ways of under-standing the world and processes of global change?
-   What could such learning processes contribute to the development of effective responses to global change and how can we best promote them

*explaining scepticism,  indifference and denialism*
-   How do we explain the so-called ‘Giddens paradox’: the fact that people remain indifferent to risks that are potentially cataclysmic?
-   How is it possible that, in the face of decades of scientific practice and the role of science in modern societies, people and politicians can so easily deny the science of climate change? 
-   What are the origins of and reasons for skepticism, denialism and inaction in the face of climate change, and what is the role of education in this regard?
-   Why are climate skeptics and denialists given so much media coverage in advanced societies? What power bases and interests are advanced by appeals for inac-tion and how can such forces be counteracted?


## Cornerstone 5 : responsibilities

  
**The  fifth  transformative  cornerstone  foregrounds  obligations,  duties  and  responsibilities  to  the  poor,  to  the  vulnerable  and to future generations, bringing these concerns into the legitimate  space  of  scientific  expertise,  policy  and  practice. it addresses methods, evaluative systems and policy mechanisms  that  can  ensure  the  use  and  relevance  of  ethical approaches in the development of new visions and building of new economies for the future.** 

The  double  injustice  imposed  by  the  effects  of  climate  and related environmental changes on already vulnerable populations and those without a voice (future generations), calls  for  urgent  work  on  understanding  what  it  takes  to  foster  global  and  inter-generational  solidarity  and  justice.  it simply cannot be assumed that all responses to climate change  are  or  will  be  framed  as  “just”  interventions.

The cornerstone on responsibilities upholds an ethical lens on all interpretations of and responses to global change, be they of a technical, political, economic or discursive nature.



### responsibilities: illustrative questions

*foregrounding normative agendas*
-   How can we best bring a normative agenda – one that foregrounds obligations, duties and responsibilities to the poor, to the vulnerable and to future generations – into the legitimate space of scientific expertise, policy and practice?
-   How do we ensure that this normative agenda is respectful of diverse cultural, faith and value systems?
-   What is the role of cooperation and solidarity in tackling global change? How do we build global and local econ-omies and societies based on these principles?


*fostering global and inter-generational  solidarity and justice*
-   to what extent do existing economic, social and politi-cal systems, policies and practices promote unjust global relations and inequalities?
-   What will it take for the world community to recognize and respond to this?
-   How can we ensure that responses to climate and broader global change, including processes of deliber-ate social transformation, integrate and foster global and inter-generational justice?
-   What legal structures are required at different geopoliti-cal levels to address multiple aspects of justice in global dimensions?

*Safeguarding ethical approaches*
-   What are the practical consequences – also for policy making – of understanding climate change and global change as ethical problems? 
-   What tools and methods do we need to develop to bring ethical challenges in to quantitative evaluative measures and economic planning? 
-   When do processes aimed at driving social transforma-tion become politically and culturally unacceptable and perceived as attempts at social engineering?
-   What are the ethical aspects of geo-engineering?

## Cornerstone 6 : governance and  decision making

**The final transformative cornerstone addresses a large and important set of questions about governance, choice and decision making. much of the policy processes related to climate  change  and  global  environmental  change  remain  poorly  understood.**  

Social  science  knowledge  is  needed  on how decisions are made in the face of uncertainty, what pathways  are  available  for  influencing  decision  making,  what  determines  the  success  or  failure  of  political  agree-ments  and  what  drives  political  will.  Knowledge  is  also  needed on the possible effects of different ways of framing global change problems on policy makers and practition-ers;  not  all  expert  input  has  the  same  policy  appeal  or  is  given  equal  hearing  by  those  in  power.  this  cornerstone  emphasizes  the  importance  of  understanding  the  role  of  science  in  the  policy  process,  of  knowing  more  clearly  what  makes  knowledge  work,  whose  knowledge  counts  under what circumstances, and where the limits of expert knowledge lie. this cornerstone leads, finally, to a focus on issues of institutional reform, new institutional design and the  building  –  at  different  levels  –  of  structures  to  enable  dialogue  across  competing  interests,  values  and  world-views and under conditions of continued uncertainty



### governance and  decision making: illustrative questions

*Coming to grips with policy processes and political will*
-   How do policy processes related to questions of climate change and global change actually work? How do we make decisions in the face of uncertainty?
-   Who determines the choices available and what path-ways exist for influencing policy agendas and decision making processes?
-   What is the role of scientific knowledge and media in processes of political decision making and  policy formulation? What role do emotions play  in such processes?
-   How do we use the future in making policies for today? What blind spots and assumptions about the future do we inject into our decision making?
-   What determines why political agreements  succeed or fail?
-   What drives commitment to political action?  What are the barriers to such commitment and how can these be overcome?
-   could a reframing of climate change – e.g. in terms of human wellbeing – make for more attractive, entic-ing and pragmatic policy goals? if so, how should we reframe the issue?
-   Should climate change be mainstreamed and if so,  how do we ensure policy coherence?

*making knowledge work*
-   How can we best increase the delivery and use of knowledge for global change; how do we get decision makers to pay attention to the results of research? 
-   Who has access to decision makers; whose knowledge counts and why? How do we ensure cognitive justice, equality of knowledge claims and access to the  policy process?

*building relevant institutions and structures*
-   What decision making institutions and structures do we ideally need at different levels to address issues of climate change? And how do we ensure dialogue and collaboration across these levels?
-   is the global scale of governance still relevant when it comes to forward looking action on climate change? Where are possible new global coalitions to come from?
-   How do we ensure democracy in global governance? What would constitute real, authentic, meaningful par-ticipation by multiple actors and how can we ensure it?
-   do we need radically new political regimes and forms of democracy and, if so, of what kind and are they feasibl?
-   Would the integration of local and indigenous knowl-edge with academic knowledge and technology lead to more effective solutions to global change and, if so, how best do we accomplish this?

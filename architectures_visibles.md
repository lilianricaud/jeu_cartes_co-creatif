# ARCHITECTURES VISIBLES

Let's imagine a group of people. It can be 20 or a few hundreds, it doesn't really matter. The way people are
going to be placed into space is going to have a crucial influence in the way they will relate to one another,
how they build a collective sense of reality, how the build a sense of the collective itself, how they make their
decision. Are people seating in a circle or is the group broken down in separate tables? Are they around a
square table? A round one? Are they in a train? On the beach? In a restaurant? In a classroom or an
amphitheater all looking at the same person? Who can see who? Who sees the back of who? How does the
room look like? What are the colors? What messages does the furniture carry? Is it an old England castle with
colonial design or a functional corpotate open space? Is there natural sun light or neons? 
 
In these examples we see that all these settings are crucial for determining how the collective is going to
operate. Put this group in a prison in separated cells, or put everyone in an open circle, and we don't have the
same decision making process, although we stay with the same persons.
 
Just like visible architecture, invisible architectures provoke specific social outcomes and patterns. They
influence the way people relate to themselves and to one another, they trigger specific behaviors that lead to
specific forms of consciousness and ways to relate to reality.

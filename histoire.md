# HISTOIRE


For Dave Snowden (2009), stories are the fundamental patterning devices through which we communicate, learn, and understand the world in a fragmented unstructured anecdotal way. This patterning occurs using micro-narrative rather than complete stories. Stories are fractal in nature, and the capture and exchange of large amounts of micro-narratives determine how our identities are shaped. This is what operates at the family table when we exchange pieces of family stories and consolidate our family identity. When we consciously reflect on these patterns, bringing them from the unself-conscious realm, to the conscious realm, they can serve as boundary object, or objects of inquiry.

“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people together to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea”

 Antoine de Saint-Exupéry



## Narrative analysis

A narrative analysis of power encourages us to ask: Which stories define cultural norms? Where did these stories come from? Whose stories were ignored or erased to create these norms? What new stories can we tell to more accurately de- scribe the world we see? And, perhaps most urgently, what are the stories that can help create the world we desire?

Narrative power analysis starts with the recognition that the currency of story is not necessarily truth, but rather meaning.

identify underlying assumptions

Are there larger mythologies of the dominant culture that must be challenged ?

La rhétorique classique propose trois rythmes canoniques :

    celui qui consiste à instaurer des arguments forts en exorde et en épilogue et ménager le public entre-temps, appelé l'« ordre homérique »106 ;
    celui qui consiste à commencer par des arguments faibles puis à progresser de manière ascendante (ou l'inverse) est recommandé par Quintilien ;
    celui qui consiste enfin à mettre en premier les arguments logiques puis ceux qui plaisent et enfin ceux qui émeuvent suivant l'ordre formulé par l'adage « docere, placere, movere ».

De nombreux auteurs ont proposé au cours de l'histoire des plans-types, allant de deux à sept parties parfois ; cependant, la tradition rhétorique n'en retient que quatre

# REGENERATIVE SYSTEMS

Regenerative ystems is a conceptual framework where systems are created through thoughtful integration of design elements so the can enhance and recreate themselves without dependence on imported inputs.

Once established, these regenerative systems do the bulk of the work, so you don't have to. they maximize the return on your initial investments.

Anytime we invets effort, time, money, material, or labor, we basically do so in one of the three ways :
- degeneratively,
- generatively,
- regeneratively

## Degenerative systems
a degenerative investment :
- starts to degrade or break down as soon as it is made; 
- Requires ongoing investments of energy and outside inputs to keep it functional;
- Consumes more resources than it produces;
- Typically serves only one function;
- Examples includes : ornemental lawns and landscapes dependent on chemical fertilizers, and irrigation water imported from deep wells, or municipal utilities; mechanically heated and cooled building powered by imported energy; and conventional single-use parking lots.


## Generative systems
a generative investment :
- starts to degrade as soon as it is made; 
- Requires ongoing investments of energy and outside inputs to keep it functional;
- Produces more resources than it consumes;
- Typically serves only multiple functions;
- Examples includes : multi-use landscapes (producing multiples resources such as food, beauty, and wildlife habitat); passively heated, cooled, and lit buildings; durable energy products such as solar, micro-hydro, and wind power systems (turning buildings into "clean" energy producers); parking lots that grow a carport orchard of food-producing shade-trees using harvested stormwater; and constructed rainwater-harvesting structures that increase the use and accessibility of on-site water resources.

## Regenerative systems
a regenerative investment :
- Can repar and recreate or regenerate itself;
- Starts to grow or improve once it is made;
- Does not require ongoing investments of energy and outside inputs to keep it functional;
- Produces more resources than it consumes;
- Typically serves only multiple functions;
- Can reproduce itself;
- Examples includes : multi-use landscapes living solely off natural rainfall and requiring no additional ressources aster establishment; self-regenerating natural forests and ecosystems, revolving community loan funds; and vegetative rainwater harvesting structures that build and repair themselves after establishment.

# Holmgren's permaculture principles applied to business


Observe
list resources/wastes(=unused resources)
Obtain a yield (start small)
Observe again (feedback)don't grow too fast, don't be too hungry
Use renewable resources
Produce no waste
Design from pattern to details
Integrate rather than segregate
Use small and slow solutions the bigger they are the harder they fall, slaw and steady wiin the race
Use and value diversity don't put all your eggs in the same basket
Use edge and value the marginal, dont think you are right because on well beaten path
creativelly use and respond to change

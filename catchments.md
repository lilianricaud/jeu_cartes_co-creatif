# Catchments

Catchments are special patterns/configurations that accumulates energy/matter in such a way that they allow the emergence of a new order with new properties.

Example given by permaculture teacher Brad Lancaster:

One-rock dam:
 
place a few rocks in a eroded slope. Correctly placed this will be enough to slow down the water flow, accumulate soil that will allow a few plants to grow. this will help retain more soil and slow down more water, that in turn will help more plant grow. this is an example of a vertuous circle, a positive self reinforcing feedback loop.



## Remaining questions 
- How can we create  "catchments in web of trust"
- Differences between catchments and dissipative structures ?

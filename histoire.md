# HISTOIRE


For Dave Snowden (2009), stories are the fundamental patterning devices through which we communicate, learn, and understand the world in a fragmented unstructured anecdotal way. This patterning occurs using micro-narrative rather than complete stories. Stories are fractal in nature, and the capture and exchange of large amounts of micro-narratives determine how our identities are shaped. This is what operates at the family table when we exchange pieces of family stories and consolidate our family identity. When we consciously reflect on these patterns, bringing them from the unself-conscious realm, to the conscious realm, they can serve as boundary object, or objects of inquiry.

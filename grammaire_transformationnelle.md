Les règles du langage sont des transformations:le langage fournit une série de règles qui autorise certaines transformations qui ont un sens mais interdit les autres. Les transformations typiquement autorisées sont la substitution, l'inversino, la concaténation.

Rules of language are transformations

A string creating system was defined; grammaire_the starting point was usually a nul sentence consisting of a single character, or word, or null string.the language provides a series of rules which allowed certain kinds of transformations which would elaborate a give string, and turn it into another string  which is allowed. Typical allowed transformations include substitution, inversion, concatenation. 

The rules of the language were then these transformations. A legitimate sentence in english was any sentence that could be derived by successive transformations. A legitimate proposition in arythmetic was any sentence (string of characters) which could be obtained  by sucessive transformations of the base string.

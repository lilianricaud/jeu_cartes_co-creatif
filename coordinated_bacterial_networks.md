# COORDINATED BACTERIAL NETWORKS

Quorum sensing controls important functions (biofilm formation, virulence factors production, ...)
-> dynamic intercellular signalling "semantics" and "syntax" of signaling -> emergent phenomenon.

Electromicrobial networks: bacteria grow nanowires that conduct electricity. Through these nanowires, bacterias interaconnect their electrons flows to optimize vital access to oxygen, effectivelly forming an integrated community engaging in coordinated respiration. Such microbial networks in soil may extend for hundreds of meters. Some look like neural networks.

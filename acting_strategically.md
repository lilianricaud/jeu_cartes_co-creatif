# Acting strageically 

Developping a strategy is simple, anwer this four questions:

- Where are we now ?
- Where do we want to go ?
- Why ?
- How do we get there ?



Developping *good* strategy is a craft. constantly revising, refining, making meaning.

Day to day work. 

Good strategy outline a visionand clear set of priorities (include what not to do).

tells a story, characteres, emotionnaly compeling

Not a recipe, context matters, not a one off, needs to be constantly revisit, refine.

The ultimate goal is not to have a strategy but act strategically**

Act strategy requires muscles,
Developping muscles requires exercices.

shared understanding and moving in alignement with a shared intention

constant cycle of aligning / acting and reflecting.

the more you do this, the more yo build your muscles for developping strategy and acting strategically.

Strategy is a habit.
- Pausing
- Asking "why?"
- coutering blind spots, have self awareness on individual and collective blind spots -> get more perspectives

ask strategic questions: 
Answer them, learn, reflect.
observe what kind of questions come back ?

More perspective means better thinking.
This all hard work.

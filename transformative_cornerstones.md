## Cornerstone 1: Historical and contextual complexities - Illustrative questions

*Distinguishing multiple stressors, drivers and interdependencies*
-   What are the multiple stressors and drivers of climate and broader processes of global change and how are these interconnected?
-   How do we -  or should we -  situate climate change in the so-called confluence of crises characterizing current global realities?
-   How does the climate crisis relate to other actual or approaching social crises, including those of unsustain-able development, finance, economic injustice, food, health, migration, poverty and security?
-   What are the causal mechanisms that connect vulnerability to global change with vulnerability to other social processes such as population displacement and migration, power inequalities and conflict?

*Learning from history*
-   What are the historical drivers that have led to high car-bon systems, lifestyles and current models of progress? How do we account for and track the influence on global change processes of dominant neoliberal think-ing and the marketization of all social life?
-   What histories -  of behaviours, institutions and systems -  have generated a world living beyond its natural limits? What predictors can we identify on the basis of such histories?
-   What lessons can we learn from environmental history case studies and how can these be replicated today?


*Dealing with differences across  geographical, cultural, personal,  professional contexts and identities*
-   What are the contextual drivers of behaviours that con-tribute to global change?
-   How are climate and related global change risks, events, actions and reactions perceived and experienced in different geographical, cultural, personal and professional contexts?
-   How are such experiences mediated by gender, race, ethnic and class identities?
-   What role do social and cultural identities play in peoples’ ability to cope with and recover from the impacts of global change?

## Cornerstone 2: Consequences - Illustrative questions

*Living with global change: taking stock of threats and impacts  across different groups and regions*
-  What are the real threats and actual, unfolding impacts of climate and broader global change on different groups and communities in different parts of the world?
-   What are the consequences in the most vulnerable regions, such as Africa, Latin America and South Asia? 
-   What are the consequences for marginalized people and communities in advanced economies? 
-   What are the lives of the victims of global change really like, how do they perceive threats and how do they typically react, individually and socially


*Identifying social boundaries and tipping points*
-   How do people and institutions understand and antici-pate the risks of social boundaries and social tipping points in relation to global change?
-   What are the consequences of global change for the basic social fabric of life: for institutions such as the family, welfare systems, legal rules, rights and duties, or private-public interactions?
-   do the consequences of global change lead to more or less social cohesion and solidarity; to what extent do they exacerbate crisis and conflict and drive the privatization of security and militarization of society?

*Measuring success: Improving the out-comes of specific actions and instruments*
-   What are the outcomes of specific climate change policy instruments and actions, including for example economic incentives and media strategies, for both mitigation and adaptation?
-   Are these responses working well for people and socie-ties? do they lead to transformative change or do they perpetuate existing marginalisation and inequalities? 
-   What are the unintended or unexpected consequences of measures aimed at addressing the impacts of global change; what new vulnerabilities, if any, do our policies and economic measures give rise to?
-   How can we best monitor, measure and evaluate policy actions and instruments; how do we know that we are moving towards resilience and sustainability?

## Cornerstone 3: Conditions and visions for change

the third transformative cornerstone addresses the impor-tant issue of change itself. it asks how change happens, at what levels and scales, and in what directions. the purpose here is to understand what drives individual and collective processes  of  change,  as  well  as  change  in  social  prac-tices. it is to identify what leadership and other capacities are  required  for  successful  change  to  occur,  whilst  being  absolutely clear about the limitations and democratic pit-falls  of  deliberate  processes  of  change.  this  cornerstone  aims  to  shed  light  on  criteria  for  successful,  transforma-tive  actions  towards  equitable  sustainability  at  the  local,  community level, and on how to speed and scale those up into processes of transformative global thinking. 

### Conditions and visions for change: illustrative questions

*understanding how we can change  behaviour and social practice*
-   What drives individual and collective behavioural change and change in social practices; what are the preconditions for and barriers to change in behaviours and practices?
-   What influence does our (evolving) knowledge of global change drivers and impacts have on the decisions and practices of individuals and communities?
-   What examples do we have of successful, local trans-formative action and how can we motivate it, what mechanisms and incentives can we use?
-   to what extent are people and groups driven by altru-ism rather than interest? is there a role for trust and reciprocity in processes of change? And for incentives and competition? 
-   What kind of leadership is needed for change and how is it exercised in different contexts?
-   What makes for successful change agents; how do we nurture them?

Speeding and scaling up  processes of change
-   At what scale must change happen for it to make a positive difference? 
-   How can we speed and scale up change processes, especially successful, sustainable local or community-based transformative action?
-   What would unlock the connection between such action and wider processes of transformative global thinking?
-   How do we move from individual to institutional and eventual systemic processes of change? 
-   How can we use media and new modes of social com-munication to increase capacities to contest climate change, envision and build alternative socio-economic systems, development trajectories and new political realities?
-   What actions are needed in crucial economic sectors – those of energy, housing, heating, cooling, transporta-tion, and agriculture – in order to ensure a decarboniza-tion and dematerialization of the economy?

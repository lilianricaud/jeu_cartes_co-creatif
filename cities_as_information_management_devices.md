"From its origin onward", Lewis Mumford writes in his classic work The city in history, "the city may be described as a structure specially equipped to store and transmits the goods of civilization". 

Preemnint among the "goods" sored and transmitted by the city is the invaluable material of information: current prices in the marketplace; laborsaing devices dreamed up by craftsmen; new remedies for disease. This knack for capturing information, and for  bringing related pocket of information together defines how cities learn. Like-minded business cluster together because there are financial incetives to do so - what academics call economies of agglomeration - enabling craftsmen to share techniques and services that they wouldn't necessarily be able to enjoy on their own.

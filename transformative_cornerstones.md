## Cornerstone 1: Historical and contextual complexities - Illustrative questions

*Distinguishing multiple stressors, drivers and interdependencies*
-   What are the multiple stressors and drivers of climate and broader processes of global change and how are these interconnected?
-   How do we -  or should we -  situate climate change in the so-called confluence of crises characterizing current global realities?
-   How does the climate crisis relate to other actual or approaching social crises, including those of unsustain-able development, finance, economic injustice, food, health, migration, poverty and security?
-   What are the causal mechanisms that connect vulnerability to global change with vulnerability to other social processes such as population displacement and migration, power inequalities and conflict?

*Learning from history*
-   What are the historical drivers that have led to high car-bon systems, lifestyles and current models of progress? How do we account for and track the influence on global change processes of dominant neoliberal think-ing and the marketization of all social life?
-   What histories -  of behaviours, institutions and systems -  have generated a world living beyond its natural limits? What predictors can we identify on the basis of such histories?
-   What lessons can we learn from environmental history case studies and how can these be replicated today?


*Dealing with differences across  geographical, cultural, personal,  professional contexts and identities*
-   What are the contextual drivers of behaviours that con-tribute to global change?
-   How are climate and related global change risks, events, actions and reactions perceived and experienced in different geographical, cultural, personal and professional contexts?
-   How are such experiences mediated by gender, race, ethnic and class identities?
-   What role do social and cultural identities play in peoplesâ€™ ability to cope with and recover from the impacts of global change?

## Cornerstone 2: Consequences - Illustrative questions

*Living with global change: taking stock of threats and impacts  across different groups and regions*
-  What are the real threats and actual, unfolding impacts of climate and broader global change on different groups and communities in different parts of the world?
-   What are the consequences in the most vulnerable regions, such as Africa, Latin America and South Asia? 
-   What are the consequences for marginalized people and communities in advanced economies? 
-   What are the lives of the victims of global change really like, how do they perceive threats and how do they typically react, individually and socially


*Identifying social boundaries and tipping points*
-   How do people and institutions understand and antici-pate the risks of social boundaries and social tipping points in relation to global change?
-   What are the consequences of global change for the basic social fabric of life: for institutions such as the family, welfare systems, legal rules, rights and duties, or private-public interactions?
-   do the consequences of global change lead to more or less social cohesion and solidarity; to what extent do they exacerbate crisis and conflict and drive the privatization of security and militarization of society?

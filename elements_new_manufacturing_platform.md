# The elements of the new manufacturing platform

- ability to scale from one in microfactories
- globally shared designs
- global material organisation
- distributed enterprise
- distributed parallel development

The Xtreme Manufacturing platform
Open Source Ecology Extreme Manufacturing system


The magic of this method lies in synergistic, lively, distributed, parallel development – occurring both at Factor e Farm (FeF) and via global collaboration. This platform will combine parallel remote prototyping, Desisgn and CAD Flash Mobs, feedback from advisers, constant vlogging of results, Daily Standups, and Product Demos. The most remarkable feature of Scrum is that ALL STEPS MAY HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME AND MAY OCCUR IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER. The key to this is modular design – where as long as the interface between components is clearly defined – all components may be developed simultaneously. Moreover, if the effort involves breakdown into very small steps, then any single step is likely to be sufficiently low-cost that performing that step becomes feasible. Massive parallel development also means that any result provides useful feedback to inform other steps. On the Scrum Floor – or the FeF workshop – people are aware of each others’ work, they can pair up to learn, and they can swarm on a problem if needed.

Classic model:
entrepreneur
get funding
hire people
build in centralized factory

new models:
shared knowledge, code, design
value created and deposited in the commons

Care for institution: taking care of commons, infrastructure (Wikimedia fundation)
entrepreneur coalition create market scarcity 

From hardware to manufacturing
The idealized requirements for a distributed mode of manufacturing and making would be:

1 Distributed access to machinery: 3D printers, extruders, laser cutters all in fablabs)
2 Distributed access to financial capital: social lending, crowdfunding, complementary currency: bitcoin p2p currency)
3 Distributed access to physical places for collaboration: hackerspace, fablab, co-working places
4 The generalized possibility for peer learning: Internet, Wikipedia
5 The availability of appropriate legal forms to allow for entrepreneurship in this new modality: social entrepreneurs, trust, cooperatives, ethic-based structures, not for profits commons friendly forms of enterprises
6 The availability of appropriate metrics and accounting systems: sensorica  networks using open design in biology: measure open contributions to reward  for contributions
7 Access to distributed forms of energy and raw materials: community based


programmed obsolescence is not a bug, it's a feature of private production to create scarcity.

Design as community: design to make it easy for everyone to modify 

Aspects of openess:e


every technology came from ideas thought 50 years ago.


Political change come only after society change

# Seeing spaces

Physical (or virtual) spaces designed to visualize complexity.

allows to :
- seeing inside
- seeing across time
- seeing multiple possibilities

This facilitates the understanding of complex systems behavior. 

shift from putting things together to seeing and understanding in powerful ways.

For tinkering you need bulding tools
for Engineering you need conceptual tools
For science you need seeingtools that allow deep understanding and exploration.

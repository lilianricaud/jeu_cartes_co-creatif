# HARNESSING THE GLOBAL PLANT FLOOR

- **Focus on the critical value drivers** always strive to be the best at what your customers value most and partner for everything else.
- **add value through orchestration** learn the subtle art of weaving together the skills and comptencies of disparate players to creat globally integrated ecosystems for designing and making physical things.
- **instill rapid, iterative, design processes** use trial and errors, informal networking, settle core modular architectures to be able to integrate components in finished structures without having to impose much direction
- **harness modular architectures** create standards, modular architectures, APIs...
- **create a transparent and egalitarian ecosystem** share information, design tools, engineering data
- **share the costs and the risks** also share the decision-making and benefits.
- **keep a keen future watch** imagine the future
